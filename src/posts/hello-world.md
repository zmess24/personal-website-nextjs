Hello World, and welcome to my blog! My name is Zac Messinger, and I’m a generalist engineer and business professional on a constant journey of continuous learning, professional development, and self discovery. If you’re reading this, thank you for taking the time to stop by!

I know what you may be thinking - who writes a blog in 2023? What is unique about this one?

Well, over the past year, I have dedicated myself to learning everything I can about ML and AGI technologies, and while I’m still early in my journey, my goal by starting this blog is to share personal insights and learnings for those looking looking to deepen their knowledge on the exciting technologies at the forefront of reshaping our world. You might see posts ranging in scope from:

-   **Mathematical topics**, like breaking down how Gradient Descent (a popular technique for minimizing the loss in a cost function) works in a regression model.
-   **Programmatic topics**, like showcasing code examples of how to fine-tune an LLM and measure the improvements in accuracy relative to a prompt engineered model.
-   **Business topics**, such as how to integrate an ML/AI model into your existing business to improve operational efficiency, open up new income streams, and reduce costs.

I hope to demystify some of the core principles of how these technologies work not only for you, the reader, but also for myself - after all, the best way to master new skillsets is the ability to teach them to other people! Hopefully, the subjects I write about are diverse and interesting enough that anyone can enjoy them, no matter their background.

The world of technology is in a constant state of flux. New programming languages are emerging, algorithms are becoming more sophisticated, and most importantly, the ways we interact with technology are evolving. Staying stagnant is not an option if you want to stay with, or ideally, ahead of the game. Hence, I've dedicated this blog to the ethos of Kaizen, a Japanese term meaning 'change for better'. As the famous swordsmen Miyamoto Musashi once said, “The purpose of todays training is to defeat yesterday’s understanding”.

As I embark on this journey, I hope this blog serves as a source of inspiration and a resource for continuous learning for all interested. The path of learning is long, but the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, or in this case, a "Hello World."
